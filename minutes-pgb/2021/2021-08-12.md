# OSLC OP PGB Meeting minutes (12 August 2021)

**Chairs:** Jim Amsden, Andrew Berezovskyi

**Attendees:** Andrew Berezovskyi, Axel Reichwein, Jim Amsden

- Report from Andrew:
    - CM and RM were published as OASIS Standards.
    - Core and Query to become OASIS Standards on 2021-08-24 subject to passing of a call for consent.
- Koneksys is looking into developing a QM server; Jim will inquire if QM clients can submit SoUs as conforming users.
- PGB is leaning towards publishing AM PS as is and getting SoUs; Axel questions the usefulness of such a high-level vocabulary, e.g. SysML has more than 300 specializations of the SysML Element (conceptually maps to the OSLC AM Resource)
- Jim insists more work needs to be done on AM, TRS, and Config before they advance to the Candidate for OASIS Standard stage.
