# OSLC Open Project

Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC-OP) is an [OASIS Open Project](https://oasis-open-projects.org/) dedicated to the creation of open standards, reference implementations, and test suites for an open and extensible framework that enables loosely coupled integration between independently developed tools. OSLC builds on the WWW Architecture and supporting standards to define a minimal set of capabilities that support integration scenarios though standard services for resource and capability discovery and UI enablement.

For more information on OSLC, see the project's website at https://open-services.net/.
