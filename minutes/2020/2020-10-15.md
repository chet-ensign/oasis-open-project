## Minutes

### .well-known

Jim's notes and comments:

> Nick updated the issue, comments added and OK with him. No useful resolution to rootservices, not likely to be standardized. 
> 
> TRS is not discoverable in the ServiceProviderCatelog. This will need to be addressed in the TRS spec. Currently TRS providers are discovered in jazz.net app rootservices resource. 
> 
> .well-known is suppose to provide an easy way to discover the URL of the ServiceProviderCatelog. 
> 
> Given a URI to any OSLC resource, regardless of how it was obtained, have a well defined way to lead to discovery, deduce the host, port, and have a way to use that to determine the URI of some discovery content. Used by OAuth for discovery. 
> 
> OSLC resource has oslc:serviceProvider property that could be used. Any OSLC resource might be discoverable from many different service providers.
> 
> What's the value? Will it be adopted? If we have any doubts, should we defer standardization?

### PGB meeting

We will schedule time for a PGB meeting to discuss the request for SOUs that will come from the PGB. There is nothing blocking us from doing this at this time.

### Action Points

- [ ] Andrew schedules a PGB call and sends out a draft SoU note
- [ ] David drafts an SPC query proposal
- [ ] Jim does AM APs to publish a PSD
