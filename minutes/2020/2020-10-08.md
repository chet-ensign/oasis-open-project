## Minutes

### Automation and Actions discussion

- Actions was in CM 2.0 
- It was refactored out to be part of Core
- No one had adopted Actions
- RTC had an internal implementation of something similar, but not Actions
- There is no business value for proceeding with the spec.
- Was eventually not included in CM 3.0, 
- OSLC CM 3.0 does not have any way of changing the state of a ChangeRequest.
- Automated wanted to refer to Actions - Automation was refactored to do that
- Config Management has a dependency on Automation properties, mostly enumeration values referring to the state of an ongoing action. Describe the management of long running actions. Polled result gives these values.
- Depends on the terms, but not on using Automation to actually model execution of actions/operations, only status reporting of long running actions. 

Decision:

- Nick propses an update of Automation vocabulary to introduces the new terms.
- but don't update Automation spec
- Defer any continued discussion of Actions as a means of changing state of ChangeRequest.
- Should publish Automation as a PSD but that would require publishing Actions PSD as well.


### Other updates
