## Minutes

### AM PSD and the future

- [ ] Andrew opens a ballot on Dec 17.

AM shall look at the SysML work with OMG; also keep an eye on IBM RMM (Rhapsody Model Manager) work. Should incorporate the common subset into AM.

RMM is a bit too late in the dev cycle for major model changes coming from the next AM spec.

Also, Frej's suggestions can be incorporated in the AM spec (or to be branched into another spec).

AM elements shall link to DNG and RMM.

> RMM till 7.0.2 had an OSLC linking issue

### Query

When values (?) of the enumeration are compared, URIs must be used. This is due to the literal being able to change over time, while the URI is expected to be stable.

Q 3.0 addressed static prefix issues (?)

If `dcterms:identifier="12345"` does not work in an `oslc.where` and querying on that property is supported, it's a defect. Resource shapes should declare `dcterms:identifier` as an `xsd:string` in conformance with OSLC Core.

### Security guidance

Jazz and Polarion fail to include any CSP/CORS headers in their response. Andrew suggests to reference https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#sotd in the Delegated UI section.

Others think web sec standards are moving to fast for us to reference them. Andrew disagrees because https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#sotd is a proper document that can be made a normative reference and just because our standard is too slow, we should not stop from referencing other (proper) standards.


### Next meeting

The final meeting of the year will take place on Dec 17. We will check on the IANA request and listen to the proposal from Frej.
