## Minutes

### Status update QM

Almost ready, remaining items:

- shape metadata
- anchors

### Status update Query

Ready to release, minor updates to the checklist.

Nick will do the second review.

### Status update RM

Major issues done, metadata needs to be updated/checked.

- Canonical URI issue is not clear (#242).
- Error in ReSpec for the vocab conformance issues.

### Status update Nick

- Still working on the CfgM draft
- ShapeCheck needs Gradle update for JDK14
- ShapeCheck may stop working with Gradle 7

### Vocab anchors

- Do both for QM
- Jad copies once it's done for RM
- Nick is doing just that for TRS and CfgM specs
- David does not need to anything for the Query spec

### Shapes metadata

We might want to define multiple sets of shapes per domain, a less prescriptive name may be better, e.g. `ShapeCollection` or `Shapes`. Nick is generally in favour of having a specific resource type as opposed to a bare resource on which the metadata will be declared.


`rdfs:isDefinedBy` is used to link classes and properties from a vocab to its resource, we will use the same property to link ResourceShapes to a `ShapeCollection`.
