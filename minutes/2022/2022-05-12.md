## Minutes

### Project notes publication

PN work is [split up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qBEwLBeRSnfCyBvqR9SAwoPH82ZQ3J5-Gq9x92e-jVY/edit#gid=0) between Andrew and Jim. Andrew uploaded a new Core PN with a fixed link, Paul is fine with the fix.

## Lyo release

Lyo 5.0 was [released this week](https://forum.open-services.net/t/lyo-5-0-0-release/615) and addressed a [CVE-2021-41042](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41042).


### Configuration Management

- Changeset delivery (of contents to the stream, see [OSLCPOP-528](https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/issues/528)) and determining (querying) the order of the delivery should be two different concerns.
    - Determining an ordered history of changeset delivery is a desired feature.
    - Delivery lifecycle should be described as well (see [OSLCOP-201](https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/issues/201)). For now, an abandoned changeset delivery is equivalent to a `DELETE`.
    - Current ELM behavior is described [in the Jazz wiki](https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/DNGConfigManagement#factory_operations).
- We will keep Config at the PS stage and not push it towards OS for now and await for implementers to provide feedback.
