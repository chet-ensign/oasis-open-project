## Minutes

Updates:

- Updated the Core PN to fix a link in response to https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-4135.
- AM COS review period started.

Impact call discussion:

- Stable clause numbering needed if we are to reference them from profile specs.
- Profile scope need to be defined.
- How about Abstract Profiles, or, rather, Generic Profiles?
    - Parametrized by a resource type.
    - Can be reused.
    - Prevents extra work for vendors.
- One extreme is 1 profile per MAY/SHOULD clause. Not helpful for determining what capabilities are achievable.
- Need to cover use-cases
    - UI linking
        - For example, cannot create an `oslc_rm:parentOf` link from Jazz to Polarion resources.
    - API CRUD manipulation
    - TRS exposure (eg for Jazz Eng Insights)
- Full lifecycle of a profile should be considered to define a useful profile
    - Eg on the first linking profile
    - Requirements, use-case, API, testing?
    - Adopt BDD approach, even if not executable
- Market segments for the OSLC Profile users
    - Tool purchasers
    - Vendors
