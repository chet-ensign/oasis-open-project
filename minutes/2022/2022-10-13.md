## Minutes


### Profile Authentication

Michael has provided clarification on the ELM jazz apps support for OIDC. In summary:

* The ELM jazz.net applications support OIDC through the Jazz Authentication Server (JAS) OP (OIDC Provider) running on WebSphere Liberty
* ELM jazz.net apps do not currently support other OPs since there are some custom APIs added to Liberty to support jazz app needs
* JAS can delegate user authentication to some other authentication provider, but cannot provide access tokens to, nor use access tokens from another OP. As far as we know, this is not supported by OIDC either.
* ELM users wishing to use OIDC with other non-jazz based applications have two choices for authentication:
  * All apps use the same JAS OP
  * Apps that use different OPs can be connected through OAuth1.0a consumer/friend connections

That is, OSLC allows cross OIDC Provider connections through use of OAuth1.0a.

### OSLC Fest

We propose to delay [OSLC Fest](https://www.oslcfest.org) this year. We are not aware of sufficient presentation proposals for this year. And the OSLC-OP is focused on the profile, TRS and Config Management specs. Once we have more progress on the linking profile, there may be more to talk about in an OSLC Fest.

### Issue 578: TRS specification incorrect references OSLC resource paging and not LDP paging

[Issue 578](https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/issues/578) proposes recommended changes to the TRS 3.0 specification that need to be approved and applied before submitting for Candidate OASIS Standard. 

Essentially the proposal provides specific clauses that cover the relevant parts of the LDP Paging W3C note that were used in the TRS 2.0 specification, clarifying the TRS approach with respect to LDP and OSLC paging that is provided in OSLC Core 3.0. 

These proposed changes should be discussed and approved before submitting TRS 3.0 COS.

## Action items

- [x] Michael will determine of jazz apps on JAS do not require OAuth1.0a. 
- [ ] Jim (or Jad?) to publish NS files - with help of Andrew. Config Management PSD01 was published, but not TRS? Andrew says PSD01 files were published for TRS 
- [ ] Jim to publish NS files for PS01 Config and TRS, not wait until OS. COS is not really a published stage, just a milestone 

- [ ] Jim will check the release tags, at least the latest revision is tagged.
- [ ] Jim will continue the process to submit Config Management 1.0 for COS - pending 3rd SoU
- [ ] Patrick & Tanupreet to provide a SoU for Config Managemnet 1.0 (They got an email from Andrew with info)
