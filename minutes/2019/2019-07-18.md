## Agenda

_Please add your suggestions here!_

- [ ] Stable URLs preview
- [ ] RM vocabulary
- [ ] QM has a lot of styles on table elements, should these all be removed so the tables look the same in all specs?
- [ ] Do we agree on using open-services.net/specifications as the place to publish the OSLC specs? See https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin/issues/6
- [ ] Review migrated Core, AM, CM, QM and RM specs for publishing
- [ ] Prepare to vote to submit QM for public review

## Minutes

### ReSpec Updates

Proposed Changes submitted as a pull request:

* Do not generate PDF links for the latest version of the spec.
    * manual (command line script), PSD doesn't require them, don't generate them if they're not published so there are no broken links
    * process - export ReSpec HTML, use this as the source for generating the PDF.
    * Nick will review the pull request
* Do not generate PDF links for WD and PSD.
* Do not supply publication date for WDs unless set (to avoid misleading users with either too old date or today's date while the last modification actually happened somewhere in between).
* Show document status in the subtitle
* Show publication date on the same line with the status (if applicable)
* Serve ReSpec via JSDelivr that @specifies the tag.
* Add latest and latest-draft redirects for RM
* Update all published URIs to https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/

Purpose:
Update to OASIS OP templates
reduce process overhead
address different publish processes for different spec status

## Action items
- [ ] Nick reviews [pull request](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/tab-respec/pull/5) and suggest any changes needed
- [ ] Nick to send email to Jim when done
- [ ] Jim will submit PSDs to PGP, asking Chet to review formatting
