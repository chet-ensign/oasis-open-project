## Minutes

### CM PSD publication

https://github.com/oasis-open-projects/administration/issues/1 is the issue for tracking the CM PSD03 publication. Issue was closed by OASIS; Andrew asked to reopen it.

### RM vocab files

RM vocabulary inverse properties should be brough back. See https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/pull/119.

`rm.rdf` (https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/pull/119/files#diff-22b8852de67d19a9f3489ce4ac0ec7c5) was the original file that accompanied the RM 2.0 spec. The file was incorrect because it was missing inverse properties. `rm_2.0.ttl` is my conversion of this file into Turtle (specs/rm/rm_2.0.ttl). 

`requirements-management-vocab.ttl` is the current vocab file (https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/pull/119/files#diff-b3562879505ac80b83db096930018c39). It is equally missing the properties in question.

`rm_jra.ttl` contains the missing properties, was likely created by Jim and needs to be reviewed before putting them into `requirements-management-vocab.ttl`.

### Quick editing setup

David can copy the contents from https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/edit/master/specs/query/oslc-query.html, edit them locally, paste them back and create a PR w/o a Git toolchain.

### AM

Jim will propose a set of properties to include in the AM 3.0 spec that connect oslc_am:Resource to other OSLC domain resources. These will be informed by 1) the draft AM 3.0 spec from open-services.net, 2) existing Rational Design Manager implementation and jazz.net vocabulary and 3) implementation considerations for Rhapsody Model Manager (if needed). These implementations represent practical experience in handling AM resources and we can reflect that experience in AM 3.0

We will essentially abandon AM 2.1 and move to 3.0 to handle these additional properties.


## TODOs

- [ ] Andrew to make ReSpec fixes
- [ ] Jad to rework the https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/pull/119
- [ ] Jim to propose AM 3.0 roadmap
