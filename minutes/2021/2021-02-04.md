## Minutes

### IANA application

TODO:

- Split §4.2 into 4.2.1 non-normative and 4.2.2 normative
- Bring in the https://archive.open-services.net/bin/view/Main/OslcCoreSpecification#Specification_Versioning
    - Mention that 3.0 follows "Rules for new versions of OSLC specifications" from 2.0 /non-normative/.

David: Is there a distinction between major vs minor part of version? No.



### Frej Traceability Management proposal

- Current proposal overlaps with common approaches based on configuring shapes in each tool separately
- OSLC products also have limitations that do not cover everything the new proposal offers.
- Shall we make a use-case description around the compliance problem?

### OSLC Shapes

See https://docs.oasis-open-projects.org/oslc-op/core/v3.0/ps01/resource-shape.html#resourceShape-shape


Can we expect a resource shape to always have `rdf:type http://open-services.net/ns/core#ResourceShape. ` in every representation returned by an OSLC server?

1. `rdf:type` property is missing altogether from the ResourceShape constraints.
2. Adding one would make OSLC 2 implementation not compliant with OSLC 3 spec unless they add triples.
3. Other specs did not mandate it either, e.g. RM allows 0..* but says contraints MUST be followed if the type is given.

Same applies to §5.2 on Properties.

Suggestion:

1. Add a row `rdf:type` property to the constraints tables for the ResourceShape and Property resources. Two options:
    1. Make the cardinality `1..*`
    1. Keep the cardinality `0..*` and add a SHOULD clause in the description.
1. Add wording that says a resource with a given type (ie has a predefined `rdf:type`) MUST conform to its shape.
2. Add clauses that Shapes and Properties SHOULD contain `dcterms:title`.
