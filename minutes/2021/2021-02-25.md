## Minutes

### OSLC Versioning

- Nick will not leave comments
    - OSLC 2 compat is very important
    - OSLC 3 servers SHOULD do everything needed to work as a proper OSLC 2 client and implementers need to be aware that doing otherwise may risk not being OSLC 2 compatible.


**P03**

Change to "no backwards-incompatible changes".  But ot's a bit of weasel-wording. `0..n` applicable to CM shapes in OSLC Connect for Windchill, for example, where you need to provide 2 shape objects to apply to both ChangeRequests and ChangeNotices. Jazz uses a SuperShape in addition to this.
 
Andrew suggests to keep this change; update language; add a Potentially Breaking Changes section to the spec.

**P04**

we shall add client guidance. Andrew suggests to refer to all 2.0+ clients/servers as a single 

**P05**

>  OSLC 3.0 Clients - if they are accessing 2.0 servers that might return 1.0 responses without the header, then they would have to provide the header as specified in OSLC Core 2.0 Specification Versioning, 

Nick: We should recommend that a client that wants to avoid getting a 1.0 response to supply a `OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0` header.

Ian: may reword this through the permitted server behaviour.

**P07**

We should say as little as necessary to define conformant behaviour. Removing or moving to a PN is valid.

Actions:

- C-55 move to the top;
- C-43 may need to remove "server"
- P-05 can be reworded to only say that "a client that wants to avoid getting a 1.0 response SHOULD supply a `OSLC-Core-Version: 2.0` header.
- P-06 remove
- P-04 remove in favour of the normative language already in C-21 or extend it to include headers.
