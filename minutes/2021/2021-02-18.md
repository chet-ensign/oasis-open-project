## Minutes

### Core PS02 versioning

https://oslc-op.github.io/oslc-specs/specs/core/oslc-core.html#versionCompatibility

1. Discovery is optional
    1. Very hard for the client to discover fully.
1. If the D is implmented, there are two ways
    1. Link headers
    1. SPC (most likely to be implemented; was also optional in 2.0)
    1. .well-known is introducing one more discovery path.

- David thinks the MUST on the Version header is wrong.
- We will keep SPC and LDP as SHOULD/MAY without making SPC MUST.
- We have a SHOULD in the new part and MUST in the old part on Version header.
    - Jim thinks it should be a MAY.
- 

Frej: 1..* in 2.0 vs 0..* in 3.0 (missed the context). David: multiple instance shapes have undefined behaviour. Frej: multiple shapes needed to work with Report Builder. David: supply a shape that covers it all for defined behaviour. Frej: not an option. Question: what should an OSLC server do when asked by a client sending a 2.0 version header? Jim: may have changed this inadvertently and did not think tha through well enough.
