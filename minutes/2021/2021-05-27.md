## Minutes

### Paging

Discussion on suitability of w3c "spec" (David)
- first page requires entire result set
- subsequent pages do not have container
- req 6.28 is not practicable.  concurrent modification exceptions across enire server woudl result in too many false positives.  MAY would be ok for stable paging, but MUST is too strong. Andrew: this case only applies for servers which a prior admin unstable paging. Andrew: agrees this is burdensome - thinks that implementations are feasible. Disagreement: Scope is limited to the container, but computing the contents of that container may not be tractable.  For non-query containers, stability may be feasible.

need to clarify the requirements on the scope of applicability of paging. David: we don't have a use case where existing core paging is not appropriate.

What use cases would motivate use?  Andrew: linking to a page of a result. David counters that this is not a meaningful resource (could be arbitrary).

David: OSLC confmgmnt has selection resources.  How to page those?  we can use existing oslc rdf statement based paging.  6.28 is not appropriate for this case.  David: gives example of configs in a component

David: critique of 4.1.10 in the core paging spec.

Andew: 6.28 admits that a change in the container can be tolerated provided the headers are used.

Some agreement that different specs might reasonably strengthen to MUST (in case 6.28 is downgraded to SHOULD or MAY)
