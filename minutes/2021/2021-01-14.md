## Minutes

### Jazz and Swagger doc generation

https://jazz.net/gc/doc/scenarios (https://www.evernote.com/shard/s42/u/0/sh/aff3912c-06d0-466e-822a-0e62a455b290/69e64a94513c8749797a1027e1670327) is not generated from machine readable files and cannot be turned into a Swagger doc automatically.


### CCM Primer discussion and compat with SysML

Jim: look for minimum Config caps that are supported in OSLC and support them. But this is subpar, should have a machine readable representation that can express capabilities that go beyond the things definedin the OSLC specs.

? How to add SysML branching to OSLC?

David: I added a section about Branching in the Config Management primer (https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs/wiki/Configuration-Management-3.0-Primer). The config management spec doesn't say anything about branching per-se, and for good reason. Support for branching varies a lot between versioning systems. For example, some tools support branch as a first class object - there are operations to create branches as persisted entities. Other systems regard branches as simply parallel versions. While others handle branches by copying to different parts of a versioned file system (e.g. SVN). So branching is not covered by the spec. The config management spec only says how you create a new version of an artifact from an existing version. Consider where v2 was created from v1. A request to create a new version from v1 might create a new parallel version, say v2.1, so that v2 and v2.1 are parallel versions. A system that does not support parallel versions might fail the request.


Jad: we aim for the SysML-independent OSLC specs at this stage.



### Well-known

Andrew to update the PR, Jim will re-review

### IANA HTTP headers

Andrew will start with the version header.

### AM ballot

Jim will follow up with Axel and Bill to have them cast their votes.

### relatedTestPlan property missing from lyo-domains and the 3.0 PS01 spec

David: extra property not a problem, but if it uses the same namespace, it's a problem.

https://github.com/eclipse/lyo/blob/master/client/oslc-java-client-resources/src/main/java/org/eclipse/lyo/client/oslc/resources/ChangeRequest.java#L415

According to Jim's notes, those properties were deprecated in 2.0 and apparently removed from 3.0. David checked that a current Jazz product is using them.

David suggests to use `oslc:hidden` and Jim mentions `archaic` properties.

The property should be added back and marked archaic. Ideally to map it to `@Deprecated` in the generated code. David: 1..* or 1..1 properties marked archaic shall be changed to have 0..* or 0..1 cardinality. The property will not be added back to the shape. Frej: empty properties on the shape cause memory overhead.

Andrew: the term is `vs:term_status`, it is defined under  https://www.w3.org/2003/06/sw-vocab-status/note#vocab. Example:

`<rdfproperty1> vs:term_status "archaic"^^xsd:string .`
