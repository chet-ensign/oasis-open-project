# OSLC Open Project Governance

This document defines the project's community governance per [OASIS Open Projects Governance Policy](https://github.com/oasis-open-projects/documentation/blob/master/policy/project-governance.md).

## Overview

**OSLC**, an OASIS Open Project, is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community that creates next-generation APIs for cloud computing. The community is governed by this document and in accordance with [OASIS Open Project Rules](../board-docs/open-projects-rules.md) with the goal of defining how community should work together to achieve this goal.

## Code Repositories

The following code repositories are governed by the **OSLC Open Project** community and maintained under the project namespace:

* **[oslc-admin](https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-admin):** this repo, an administrative repo.
* **[oslc-specs](https://github.com/oslc-op/oslc-specs):** specifications and other documents produced by the project.

## Community Roles

* **Contributors:** People who make regular contributions to our project (documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participation in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.).
* **Maintainers**: People who have been selected by project leadership to oversee one or more components of the project, review code and PRs, prepare releases, triage issues, and similar tasks.
